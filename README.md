1. Run the script
2. Choose a Website
3. Wait sometimes for setting up all
4. Send the generated link to victim
5. Wait for victim login. As soon as he/she logs in, credentials will be captured


## Solution of common issues
 - Some secured browsers like Firefox can warn for '@' prefixed links. You should use pure links or custom link to avoid it.
 - Termux from play store in not supported. Download termux from fdroid or github
 - VPN or proxy prevents tunneling and even proper internet access. Turn them off if you have issues.
 - Some android requires hotspot to start Cloudflared. If you face 'tunneling failed' in android, most probably your hotspot is turned off.
 - If you want mailing credentials then you need to use app password. Visit [here](https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/apppasswords) and generate an app password, put that in `files/email.json`. You may need to enable 2FA before it.
